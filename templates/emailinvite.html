<p>Hello {{name}}</p>

<p>Congrats, you are receiving this email because you are now invited to register for an account at <b>beta.webrecorder.io</b></p>

<p>To start the registration, please goto:</p>
<p><b><a href="{{host}}/_register?invite={{invite}}">Register</a></b></p>

<p>(If the above link is not working, point your browser to the following url: {{host}}/_register?invite={{invite}})
</p>

<p>You can now create your very own public or private web archive. To start off, you have been allocated <b>50MB</b> and <b>20 Collections</b>
to experiment with.</p>

<p>As this is still a beta, we would really appreciate any feedback you have from using the service.</p>

<p>We are especially interested in any issues / bugs that you may run into so that we can make the service better.</p>

<p>To make it easier to report issues, there is a <b>Doesn't look right</b> on the toolbar to report any recording or playback issues. Please use this button to report anything that doesn't look right.</p>

<p>WebRecordder is under active development and we hope to add new features regularly based on your feedback.</p>

<p>All the content you archive is available for you download via the <i>Storage</i> tab in your collections. As this is a beta, we also encourage you
to make local copies of anything important that you have archived, because Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe!</p>

<p>Please contact us at support@webrecorder.io if you have any questions or concerns, or would like to provide any feedback for the project.</p>
